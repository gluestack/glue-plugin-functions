# How to install

##

<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin
    
    ```bash
    $ node glue add functions <instance-name>
    ```

<br/>


* For example, In my case I wanted to install function plugin instance with my instance name as “func1”, then I will follow this pattern to install function plugin in my app:
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add functions func1
    ```
    
    Here my instance name is func1.

<br/>


* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** 
  folder there is folder named “**functions**” and inside that **functions** folder, there
  is a new folder which is named after your instance i.e. **func1** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the function plugin instance should be something like this:
  
  **backend/functions/func1**
